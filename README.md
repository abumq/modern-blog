## Modern Blog

An extremely simple blog site built with:
 * React (Vite)
 * Typescript
 * Tailwind CSS
 * Postgres
 * React Query
 * React Hook Form

Feel free to use it to start something amazing.

### Getting Started

* Run PostgreSQL server locally or use one of the free ones on cloud
* Create `.env.local` and provide `DATABASE_URL` (or use existing `.env` if running locally)
* Install the package
```
npm i
```
* Start server
```
npm run dev:server
```
* Start client
```
npm run dev
```

Enjoy!
