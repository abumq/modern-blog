Feel free to use this project as a starting point to create something amazing! ðŸš€

### Getting Started

#### Installation

```
npm i
```

#### Database

Once you have postgreSQL up & server running, start by creating a database and table

```
psql -h localhost -U postgres -f db/init.sql
psql -h localhost -U postgres -f db/samples.sql
```

Update `.env` or create `.env.local` and provide `DATABASE_URL` for server's [connection URI](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING-URIS)

#### API Server

```
npm run dev:server
```

#### Frontend

```
npm run dev
```

Enjoy!

### Disclaimer
This project is not intended for production use as-is. The current implementation allows anyone to create, edit, and view postsâ€”no authentication or access control is provided.

The primary goal is to demonstrate the use of this tech stack and showcase a simple end-to-end CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. It's designed to serve as a learning tool or a foundation/boilerplate for your own projects.

Note: This repository is configured to serve files directly from the root of the running app. For example, you can access the LICENSE file by navigating to http://localhost:5173/LICENSE, as it is served from the root of the GitHub repository.
