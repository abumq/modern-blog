## Modern Blog

An ultra-simple blog site built with the following technologies:
 * React (Vite)
 * Typescript
 * Tailwind CSS
 * Postgres
 * React Query
 * React Hook Form

Feel free to use this project as a starting point to create something amazing! ðŸš€

### Disclaimer
This project is not intended for production use as-is. The current implementation allows anyone to create, edit, and view postsâ€”no authentication or access control is provided.

The primary goal is to demonstrate the use of this tech stack and showcase a simple end-to-end CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. It's designed to serve as a learning tool or a foundation/boilerplate for your own projects.

### Getting Started

* Run PostgreSQL server locally or use one of the free ones on cloud
* Create `.env.local` and provide `DATABASE_URL` (or use existing `.env` if running locally)
* Install the package
```
npm i
```
* Start server
```
npm run dev:server
```
* Start client
```
npm run dev
```

Enjoy!
